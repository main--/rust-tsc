//! This crate allows you to read the x86 timestamp counter (TSC)
//! for when you require very low overhead time measurements.
//!
//! Unlike other crates, this one does not require nightly Rust as it
//! uses `cc` instead of inline asm - at the cost of an additional
//! `call`+`ret` on every invocation.
